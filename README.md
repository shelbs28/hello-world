# Hello World!

__This is a repository__

I am a goofy, blonde girl who actually has really deep thoughts but likes to bury them underneath fart jokes and really loud talking.

:princess: :fire: :v:

This is a self portrait just in case you need it:

Just recently, a really cool music artist named Jon Bellion released an album. It's called _Glory Sound Prep_.

I haven't stopped listening to it since its release date. Wanna know what my order of favorite songs on the album are? 

Probably not. But I'm going to tell you anyways.

(p.s. I consider every song like a child. I don't want to pick favorites but since you didn't ask, I will. In order from least to most favorite.)

###A List of My Favorite Songs on _Glory Sound Prep_

<ol start="10" reversed>
<li> _The Internet_</li>
    It's not that I didnt like this song, it probably just has the least amount of depth to me.
    You can listen to the song [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W936TWjKZBQ)
    
    
    
    
<li> _JT_</li>
Probably the most jazzy and dance-worthy song on the album. So fun and lighthearted. It would be higher on the list, but Jon released the song earlier than he released the album, so I wore it out pretty quickly. You can listen to the song [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj1XE7fsvHw)

<li> *Conversations with my Wife*</li>
Such a romantic, technology-hating song. You can listen to it [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yku452cR6Gw)
